# Curvature, A path editor to help with Three.js / R3F work

I was searching for a way to create interesting paths in my scene to use as input for my camera motion. ðŸŽ¥

Using Catmullrom curves for this is great, but... making a nice path and get those vectors <s>is</s> was a pain. ðŸ«£

So I decided to create this editor to help me do the job. ðŸ¦„

Enjoy!
